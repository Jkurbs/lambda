JFK Airport needs you to help them design a new iPhone app to display departure information on upcoming flights.

They need your help in determining what data needs to be displayed to the user, and how to handle situations when fights are canceled, delayed, or there isn't information due to various situations.

Help them design logic that can alert customers about upcoming flights and price estimates for airfare (including checked bags).

## Instructions

Today's afternoon project is a Playground that will reinforce the topics that you covered in today's guided project.

1. Please fork and clone this repository.
2. Answer all of the questions in the AirportDepartures.playground file 

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should ... 

* be able to create custom types with `enum`, `struct`, and `class` 
* be able to unwrap optional variables safely and display appropriate placeholders
* be able to use a `switch` statement to control the logic in an app
* understand how to create a free-standing function
* understand how to add a method to a `class` or `struct` type
* be able to write calculations involving `Int` and `Double` types

## Required Features

* Answer all of the questions in the Playground file
* Make sure you address each required item

## Stretch Goals

* There are stretch goals at the bottom of questions (marked "Stretch:") to help you explore different APIs (Application Programming Interface)
	* `NumberFormatter`, `DateFormatter`, etc.
	* Use the links and hints to research these different APIs (you'll need to read the documentation)
