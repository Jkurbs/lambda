### Challenge

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome. For example, “tacocat” should return true, since it can be reversed and still spell “tacocat”. "daily" should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome. (Hint: In order to be a palindrome, the word, phrase, or sequence has to read the same backward as it does forward)

```canBePalindrome(“tacocat”) // returns true```  
```canBePalindrome("daily") // returns false```
